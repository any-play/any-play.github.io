            <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that is transfered to your
              computer through your Web browser so that servers can recognize

            <p>Cloudflares __cfduid cookie is used to override any security
              restrictions based on the IP address the visitor is coming from.
              For example, if the visitor is in a coffee shop where there are a
              bunch of infected machines, but the visitor's machine is known
              trusted, then the cookie can override the security setting. It
              does not correspond to any userid in the web application, nor does
              the cookie store any personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p>Note: This cookie is strictly necessary for site security
              operations and can't be turned off.</p>
